Steps to create a "Check Profanity" program:

Step 1: We are going to process a text file, so we call our program and pass the path of the file as a parameter

Step 2: The program reads the file and compare each work against a list of the words we consider profane

Step 3: For each profane work, we notify the user which word is, and its location(line and column), so he could act on it with this info
